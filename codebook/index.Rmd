# Presentation{-}

This codebook was made with the variables and data bases that were used in "Fabrica de Datos Laborales". The data bases are: ICTWSS, OECD, WDI, WVS, DPI, ILOSTAT, ILOEPLEX, VDemocracy, ISSP, Eurobarometer and Latinobarometer. This database allows you to make comparative analysis between different countries and years.

**Presentation**

This document and database was made by Valentina Andrade, Emilia Cuadros y Nicolás Godoy for FONDECYT N°11190229 "Determinantes institucionales y políticos del conflicto entre empresarios y trabajadores: los casos de Argentina y Chile en perspectiva comparada", leaded by Pablo Pérez Ahumada, assistant professor of the Department of Sociology of Universidad Alberto Hurtado (UAH) and associate investigator of the Centro de Estudios del Conflicto y Cohesión Social (COES). 

The objective is to explain the variations in the conflict between workers and employers in Argentina and Chile. To do this, we do a comparative analysis of the institutional (labour regulations) and political (relationship between parties and trade union movement) factors that make it up. 

For this reason, the project has proposed the construction of a **global and temporary database** on labour relations. This includes data on agreements and pacts between employers, unions and the government, political and social characteristics of workers' unions and other associations, economic relations and employment in different branches and sectors of the economy, and variables on the sociopolitical system such as indices of democracy and confidence in various institutions, among others. Data is available for an average of 60 countries and from 1789 to 2020, in general. The main sources of information are *ICTWSS, OECD, WDI, WVS, DPI, ILOSTAT, ILOEPLEX, VDemocracy, ISSP, Eurobarometer and Latinobarometer.*

With this open database, we seek to promote the open science approach from a transparent design, open data, reproducible analysis, and free publication. This means making the methodological decisions of the study transparent, providing to the community the resources used in the research, as well as allowing the data obtained to be reproduced and giving free access to the results and products of the research (LISA, 2021).

This database allows you to make comparative analysis between different countries and years. For country, we use iso3c classification.

```{r tabla iso3c}
url <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3")
iso3c <- url %>% html_nodes("span.monospaced") %>% html_text()  
iso3c <- iso3c[1:249]
country <- url %>% html_nodes("li a") %>% html_text()
country <- country[15:263]
table <- data.frame(iso3c = iso3c, Country = country)

table %>% 
  knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 10) 

```
