<p>The following variables are from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data base. It contains information of the different members of the organisation between 1960 and 2020. It provides information about Economics Relationships and Employments. Also, some variables that were extracted from WISE such as GDP and GNI per capita are included.</p>

Real Minimum Wages
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Real hourly and annual minimum wages are calculated first by deflating the series using the consumer price index taking 2019 as the base year. The series are then converted into a common currency unit (USD) using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for private consumption expenditures in 2019.

Minimum relative to median wages of full-time workers
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
For cross-country comparisons, data on minimum wage levels are further supplemented with another measure of minimum wages relative to average wages, that is, the ratio of minimum wages to median earnings of full-time employees. Median rather than mean earnings provide a better basis for international comparisons as it accounts for differences in earnings dispersion across countries. However, while median of basic earnings of full-time workers - i.e. excluding overtime and bonus payments - are, ideally, the preferred measure of average wages for international comparisons of minimum-to-median earnings, they are not available for a large number of countries.

Employment rate
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Employment rates are defined as a measure of the extent to which available labour resources (people available to work) are being used. They are calculated as the ratio of the employed to the working age population. Employment rates are sensitive to the economic cycle, but in the longer term they are significantly affected by governments’ higher education and income support policies and by policies that facilitate employment of women and disadvantaged groups. Employed people are those aged 15 or over who report that they have worked in gainful employment for at least one hour in the previous week or who had a job but were absent from work during the reference week. The working age population refers to people aged 15 to 64. This indicator is seasonally adjusted and it is measured in terms of thousand persons aged 15 and over; and in numbers of employed persons aged 15 to 64 as a percentage of working age population.

This indicator is seasonally adjusted and it is measured in terms of thousand persons aged 15 and over; and in numbers of employed persons aged 15 to 64 as a percentage of working age population.

Part time employment rate (total workers)
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Part-time employment is defined as people in employment (whether employees or self-employed) who usually work less than 30 hours per week in their main job. Employed people are those aged 15 and over who report that they have worked in gainful employment for at least one hour in the previous week or who had a job but were absent from work during the reference week while having a formal job attachment. The definition of part-time work varies considerably across OECD countries Essentially three main approaches can be distinguished: i) a classification based on the worker’s perception of his/her employment situation; ii) a cut-off (generally 30 or 35 hours per week) based on usual working hours, with persons usually working fewer hours being considered part-timers; iii) a comparable cut-off based on actual hours worked during the reference week. A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the worker’s perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off. In one country (France) which changed from 1981 to 1982 from a definition based on an actual hours cut-off (30 hours) to one based on the respondent’s perception, the latter criterion appeared to produce slightly higher estimates

Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.

Levels of GDP, GDP per capita and labour productivity are presented in current prices (national currency or current PPPs), constant prices (2015 PPPs), as well as current price and current PPPs compared to the USA. The use of these different measures depends on the aim of the analysis: If the aim is to compare countries’ GDP per capita or productivity levels for individual years, using data in current prices and current PPPs could provide interesting insights. However, if the aim is to look at developments of levels of GDP per capita or productivity over time, using data in constant prices and 2015 PPPs is more appropriate as these control also for relative prices over time in addition to those across countries.

ULCs can be calculated as the ratio of labour compensation to real GDP. It is also the equivalent of the ratio between labour compensation per labour input (per hour or per employee) worked and labour productivity .
