<h1><span class="header-section-number">Capítulo 7</span> ILOSTAT</h1>
<p>ILOSTAT is the primary source of labour statistics, containing variables about Economics Relationships and Employments as well as Political and Social Association, included in the following table. Some variables like employment share in different economic sectors, labour productivity and hourly labour productivity are from World Indicators of Skills for Employment (WISE) database. WISE was built with data from other well-known databases such as OECD and Eurostat to offer more statistical tools on skill development for different countries and in series of years from 1990 to the present.</p>

Labour productivity; ratio of GDP per employed person

Ratio of GDP per employed person in 1990 US dollars converted as PPPs. The labour productivity estimates are derived from the Total Economy Database of The Conference Board. To compute labour productivity per person engaged, GDP is divided by total employment. GDP estimates for OECD countries after 1990 are mostly obtained from the OECD National Accounts, Volumes I and II (annual issues) and the Eurostat New Cronos database. Employment estimates are primarily taken from OECD: Labour Force Statistics (annual issues); Eurostat’s New Cronos database; the ILO estimates on employment; and the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies (WIIW). For countries outside of the OECD, the national accounts and labour statistics which were assembled from national sources by international organizations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the ILO and the United Nations Statistical Office were used as the point of departure.

The earnings of employees relate to the gross remuneration in cash and in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. This is a harmonized series: (1) data reported as weekly, monthly and yearly are converted to hourly using data on average weekly hours if available; and (2) data are converted to U.S. dollars as the common currency, using exchange rates or using 2017 purchasing power parity (PPP) rates for private consumption expenditures. The latter series allows for international comparisons by taking account of the differences in relative prices between countries.

The earnings of women plant and machine operators, and assemblers relate to the gross remuneration in cash and in kind paid to women plant and machine operators, and assemblers, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. This is a harmonized series: (1) data reported as weekly, monthly and yearly are converted to hourly using data on average weekly hours if available; and (2) data are converted to U.S. dollars as the common currency, using exchange rates or using 2017 purchasing power parity (PPP) rates for private consumption expenditures. The latter series allows for international comparisons by taking account of the differences in relative prices between countries.

Labour income share as a percent of GDP
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Imputed observations are not based on national data, are subject to high uncertainty and should not be used for country comparisons or rankings.The labour income share in GDP is the ratio, in percentage, between total labour income and gross domestic product (a measure of total output), both provided in nominal terms. Labour income includes the compensation of employees and part of the income of the self-employed. Self-employed workers earn from both their work and capital ownership. Total compensation of employees refers to the remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an enterprise to an employee in return for work done by the latter during the accounting period. The labour income of self-employed is imputed on the basis of a statistical analysis of employees of similar characteristics. The labour income share after accounting for the labour income of the self-employed is often referred to as the adjusted labour income share in GDP. The series is part of the ILO modelled estimates and is harmonized to account for differences in national data and scope of coverage, collection and tabulation methodologies as well as for other country-specific factors. We use data that comes from administrative data, imputed and modelled observations.

Imputed observations are not based on national data, are subject to high uncertainty and should not be used for country comparisons or rankings. The employed comprise female persons of working age who, during a specified brief period, were in one of the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). Data are disaggregated by status in employment according to the latest version of the International Standard Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE-93). Status in employment refers to the type of explicit or implicit contract of employment the person has with other persons or organizations. The basic criteria used to define the groups of the classification are the type of economic risk and the type of authority over establishments and other workers which the job incumbents have or will have. The series is part of the ILO modelled estimates and is harmonized to account for differences in national data and scope of coverage, collection and tabulation methodologies as well as for other country-specific factors.

Collective bargaining coverage rate (%)
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining, that is, all those workers whose pay and/or conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective agreement(s). Collective bargaining agreements refer to all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of emplores or one or more employers’ organisations, on the one hand, and one or more representative workers’ organisations, on the other. Collective bargaining coverage includes, to the extent possible, workers covered by collective agreements by virtue of their extension, as well as workers covered by collective agreements concluded in previous years but still in force.
