El objetivo del proyecto es explicar las variaciones en el conflicto entre trabajadores y empresarios en Argentina y Chile. Para ello, se desarrolla un análisis comparado de los factores institucionales (regulaciones laborales) y políticos (relación entre partidos y movimiento sindical) que lo configuran. Por ello el proyecto se ha propuesto la construcción de una base de datos a nivel mundial y temporal sobre (relaciones laborales que incluye aquí indicaremos los módulos, con datos disponibles para número total de países promedio desde años.

2001:148). 6= Government-imposed bargaining (incl. statutory controls in lieu of bargaining) 5= Government-sponsored bargaining (this includes pacts) 4= Inter-associational by peak associations 3= Intra-associational (informal centralisation) 2= Pattern bargaining 1= Government sets signals (public sector wages, minimum wage). 0= No specific mechanism identified factor govint _ictwss Government intervention in wage bargaining Government intervention in wage bargaining based on on Hassel, 2005, p. 75, who re-organised the 15-points scale of Golden, Lange and Walllerstein(2006), into a five-point scale, and Visser (2019), who made some changes. 5 = the government imposes private sector wage settlements, places a ceiling on bargaining outcomes or suspends bargaining; 4 = the government participates directly in wage bargaining (tripartite bargaining, as in social pacts); 3 = the government influences wage bargaining outcomes indirectly through price-ceilings, indexation, tax measures, minimum wages, and/or pattern setting through public sector wages; 2 = the government influences wage bargaining by providing an institutional framework of consultation and information exchange, by conditional agreement to extend private sector agreements, and/or by providing a conflict resolution mechanism which links the settlement of disputes across the economy and/or allows the intervention of state arbitrators or Parliament; 1 = none of the above. factor peace _ictwss Presence of peace clauses in sectoral and/or cross-sectoral collective agreement Constructed based on the following question: Do collective agreements imply a peace obligation and/or typically include a peace clause? 2 =strikes may not be called over the terms of the collective agreement while the agreement is in force (which implies a peace clause)1= there is no (implicit or explicit) legal obligation, but in practice most (private sector) collective agreements contain a peace clause0=no peace obligation or peace clause factor cor _ictwss Conflicts of Rights Constructed based on the following question: Do collective agreements typically include a mediation or arbitrationprocedure for handling grievances? 2 =yes, obligatory1 =yes, voluntarily0 =no or very rare. factor coi _ictwss Conflicts of Interest Constructed based on the following question: Are arbitration or mediation procedures used in case of conflicts of interest (over new agreements or renewal and change of existing or expired collective agreements)? 2 =yes, obligatory1 =yes, voluntarily and frequently0 =no or very rar factor level _ictwss Predominant level of wage bargaining The predominant level at which wage bargaining takes place (in terms of coverage of employees). 5 =bargaining predominantly takes place at central or cross-industry level negotiated at lower levels; 4 = intermediate or alternating between central and industry bargaining; 3 =bargaining predominantly takes place at the sector or industry level; 2 =intermediate or alternating between sector and company bargaining; 1 =bargaining predominantly takes place at the local or company level factor combi _ictwss Combination of levels of wage bargaining The combination of levels at which collective bargaining over wages takes place 7 =cross-sectoral (entire economy or private sector, with centrally determined binding norms or ceilings to be respected by all further agreements; 6 =cross-sectoral (entire economy or private sector) and sectoral, with sectoral agreements that specify, or deviate from, central agreements, guidelines or targets; 5 =cross-sectoral (entire economy or private sector), sectoral and company, with company agreements that specify/deviate from sector agreements, and sector agreements that specify/deviate from central agreements; 4 =cross-sectoral (entire economy or private sector) and company, with company agreements that specify/deviate from central agreements; 3 =sectoral (separate branches of the economy), with sectorally determined binding norms or ceilings to be respected by all further agreements; 2 =sectoral (separate branches of the economy) and company, with company agreements that specify, or deviate from, sectoral agreements, guidelines or targets; 1 =enterprise (company, or units thereof) factor bargcent _ictwss Centralisation of wage bargaining The variable rAEB measures the incidence of additional enterprise bargaining, weighted by it being under control, or not, of the same union(s) that negotiate(s) the higher order agreements (Art). The space left to additional bargaining is defined by the hierarchical ordering of agreements (Fav), and the tightness of wage norms in central and sectoral agreements (WSSA). The variables (OCG) and (OCT) measure the incidence of general and temporary opening clauses allowing bargainers at company level to negotiate outcomes that (1-5) = [Level - ((rAEB*Art)+FAV+WSSA+OCG+OCT)/10]. numeric raeb _ictwss Reach/incidence of additional enterprise bargaining Defined as the proportion of firms and workers simultaneously covered by both industry (or cross-industry) and enterprise agreements (not to be confused with single employer bargaining, which is the subject of a later variable, SEB). 3 = additional enterprise bargaining on wages is common (more than half of employees covered are affected); 2 = additional enterprise bargaining on wages occurs only in large firms (between 10 and 50 percent of employees are affected); 1 = additional enterprise bargaining on wages is rare even in large firms (less than 10 percent of employees are affected); 0 = no additional enterprise-level bargaining on wages (including cases where it is forbidden) factor art _ictwss Articulation of enterprise bargaining Articulation is defined as role differentiation and mutual dependence of negotiators at different bargaining levels. A fully articulated system is one in which the actions of the centre are frequently predicated on securing the consent of lower levels, and the autonomous action of lower levels is bounded by rules of delegation and scope for discretion ultimately controlled by successively higher levels (Crouch 1993:54-5) 3 = articulated: additional enterprise bargaining on wages is recognized and takes place under control of the outside union; 2 = partially articulated: additional enterprise bargaining on wages takes place under control of the (non-union) works council; the signatory or signatories of sector and company agreements are bound by different rules and control of the outside union is partial 1 =disarticulated bargaining; additional enterprise bargaining on wages when it happens is, formally or informally, also conducted by non-union bodies and not answerable to or under control of the outside union. factor dr _ictwss Possible to derogate from terms established by law (and offer less favourable co Defined as the possibility to deviate from statutory norms by means of collective agreement and set different and in some cases less favourable standards than those specified in the law on non-wage issues, especially on maximum or minimum hours and employment protection. 1= it is possible to derogate from terms established by law (and offer less favourable conditions) by means of collective agreement 0=it is not possible to derogate from the law factor fav _ictwss Favourability principle between agreement-levels Favourability defines the hierarchical relationship of agreements in a multi-level setting and guarantees that lower-level agreements can only deviate from higher-level agreements in ways thatare favourable for workers. 3 = Favourability is inversed, terms in lower level agreements take precedence; 2= Hierarchy between levels is undefined and a matter for the negotiating parties (not fixed inlaw); 1= Lower-level agreements must by law offer more favourable terms, but derogationis possible under defined conditions; 0=Hierarchy between agreement-levels is strictly appliedand defined in law: lower-level agreements can only offer more favourable terms factor wssa _ictwss Wage setting in sectoral agreements Sectoral or national agreements differ in how they regulate wages. These different types imply different levels of decentralisation, with standard agreements the least decentralised and figureless agreements the most. Code 2 is equivalent with default and figureless agreements in the classificationof Ibsen and Keune; code 1 with minimum and corridor agreements. In the case of mixed agreements, the coding follows the rules applying to wages. In general, codes apply to the practice in manufacturing industries. For more information: Ibsen and Keune (2018) 2= sectoral agreements set the framework or define the default for enterprise bargaining; 1= sectoral agreements define the minimum wage level (and minimum rate changes); 0= sectoral agreements define the minimum and actual levels (and rate changes) of wages factor ocg _ictwss General Opening clauses in collective agreement Opening clauses in sectoral collective agreements 2= Sectoral agreements contain opening clauses, allowing the renegotiation of contractual wages at enterprise level; 1 = Sectoral agreements contain opening clauses, allowing the renegotiation of contractual non-wage issues (working time, schedules, etc) at enterprise level: 0= Agreements contain no opening clauses factor oct _ictwss Crisis-related, temporary opening clauses in collective agreement Crisis-related, temporary opening clauses in collective agreement 1 = Agreements (at any level) contain crisis-related opening clauses, defined as temporary changes, renegotiation or suspension of contractual provisions, under defined hardship conditions; 0 = Agreements contain no opening clauses factor index _ictwss General price indexation or cost-of-living clauses in agreements General price indexation or cost-of-living clauses in agreements 1= (Most or many) collective agreements contain (sem-) automatic index or cost-of-living escalator clauses, linking wages to prices. 0= use of index clauses is rare or forbidden factor ext _ictwss Mandatory extension of collective agreements to non- organised employers Mandatory extension of collective agreements to non-organised employers. Extension is a legal act in which (clauses in) a collective agreement negotiated between one or more unions and one or more employers associations is (are) declared binding on firms that are not member of the contracting parties(Hayter and Visser 2018). Extension as defined here does not include employers who, by custom and practice, orient their pay policies on the collective agreement of organised firms. 3 =extension is virtually automatic and more or less general (including enlargement) 2 =extension is used in many industries, but there are thresholds and Ministers can (and sometimes do) decide not to extend (clauses in) collective agreements 1 = extension is rather exceptional, used in some industries only, because of absence of sector agreements, very high thresholds(supermajorities of 60_or more, public policy criteria, etc.), and/or veto powers of employers 0 =there are neither legal provisions for mandatory extension, nor is there a functional equivalent. factor length _ictwss Average length of (wage clauses in) collective agreements, in months Length or duration of collective (wage) agreements (1-8) average length of (wage clauses in) collective agreements, in months numeric nmw _ictwss National Minimum Wage Prescence of National Minimum Wage 2 = Statutory national (cross-sectoral or inter-occupational) minimum wageexists. 1 = Statutory minimum wage in some sectors (occupations, regions/states) only; 0 = No statutory minimum wage. factor nmws _ictwss Minimum Wage Setting Minium Wage Setting levels. 0 = No statutory minimum wage, no sectoral or national agreements; 1 = Minimum wages are set by (sectoral) collective agreement or tripartite wage boards in (some) sectors; 2 = Minimum wages are set by national (cross-sectoral or inter-occupational) agreement (autonomous agreement) between unions and employers; 3 = National minimum wage is set by agreement (as in 1 or 2) but extended and made binding by law or Ministerial decree; 4 = National minimum wage is set through tripartite negotiations; 5 =National minimum wage is set by government after (non-binding) tripartite consultations; 6 =Minimum wage set by judges or expert committees, as in award-system; 7 = Minimum wage is set by government, bound by a fixed rule (index-based minimum wage); 8 = Minimum wage is set by government based on a fixed rule (index-based minimum wage) or target (growth, employment, poverty), but government can (and sometimes does) take a discretionary decision; 9=Minimum wage is set by government, without a fixed rule factor pactneg _ictwss A social pact is proposed by government, unions or employers, and negotiations d A social pact is (publicly) being proposed by the government, the unions or the employers, and negotiations do take place in specified year 0 = no 1 = yes 2 = two pacts in same year 3 =three pacts in same year () factor pactsign _ictwss A social pact between government, unions and/or employers is signed in specified A (tripartite) social pact between the government, the unions and the employers, or between the government and the unions, is signed in specified year.

NA numeric mrw_ocde Minimum relative to median wages of full-time workers For cross-country comparisons, data on minimum wage levels are further supplemented with another measure of minimum wages relative to average wages, that is, the ratio of minimum wages to median earnings of full-time employees. Median rather than mean earnings provide a better basis for international comparisons as it accounts for differences in earnings dispersion across countries. However, while median of basic earnings of full-time workers - i.e. excluding overtime and bonus payments - are, ideally, the preferred measure of average wages for international comparisons of minimum-to-median earnings, they are not available for a large number of countries.

Employed people are those aged 15 and over who report that they have worked in gainful employment for at least one hour in the previous week or who had a job but were absent from work during the reference week while having a formal job attachment. The definition of part-time work varies considerably across OECD countries Essentially three main approaches can be distinguished: i) a classification based on the workers perception of his/her employment situation; ii) a cut-off (generally 30 or 35 hours per week) based on usual working hours, with persons usually working fewer hours being considered part-timers; iii) a comparable cut-off based on actual hours worked during the reference week. A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the workers perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off.

(0-100) numeric hrs_work_te_ocde Average hours worked per worker (total workers) Average annual hours actually worked per worker (total workers) is defined as the total number of hours worked over the year divided by the average number of people in employment. The data are intended for comparisons of trends over time; they are unsuitable for comparisons of the level of average annual hours of work for a given year, because of differences in their sources. Part-time workers are covered as well as full-time workers. NA numeric hrs_work_de_ocde Average hours worked per worker (dependent workers) Average annual hours actually worked per worker (dependent workers) is defined as the total number of hours worked over the year divided by the average number of people in employment.

It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used. NA numeric gni_ocde GNI per capita GNI per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GNI is gross national income (GNI) converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GNI as a U.S. dollar has in the United States. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. Data are in current international dollars based on the 2011 ICP round. NA numeric tradeopen_wb Trade Openess Trade in services is the sum of service exports and imports divided by the value of GDP, all in current U.S. dollars. The indicator provides a summary measure of globalisation which may have an impact on skill demands. Source: International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and data files, and World Bank and OECD GDP estimates NA numeric hdi_undp Human Development Index The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth component of the HDI is calculated using a minimum value of 20 years and maximum value of 85 years. The education component of the HDI is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. Mean years of schooling is estimated by UNESCO Institute for Statistics based on educational attainment data from censuses and surveys available in its database. Expected years of schooling estimates are based on enrolment by age at all levels of education. This indicator is produced by UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Expected years of schooling is capped at 18 years. The indicators are normalized using a minimum value of zero and maximum aspirational values of 15 and 18 years respectively. The two indices are combined into an education index using arithmetic mean. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The goalpost for minimum income is $100 (PPP) and the maximum is $75,000 (PPP). The minimum value for GNI per capita, set at $100, is justified by the considerable amount of unmeasured subsistence and nonmarket production in economies close to the minimum that is not captured in the official data. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI.The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. NA numeric pop_wb Total Population Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenshipexcept for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. The values shown are midyear estimates. NA numeric pop_fem_wb Percentage of population that is female Population, female (% of total) is the percentage of the population that is female (0-100) numeric gdp_growth_ocde GDP Growth Annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2005 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Provides an overall indicator of aggregate economic performance. (0-100) numeric lp_ilo Labour productivity; ratio of GDP per employed person Ratio of GDP per employed person in 1990 US dollars converted as PPPs. The labour productivity estimates are derived from the Total Economy Database of The Conference Board. To compute labour productivity per person engaged, GDP is divided by total employment. GDP estimates for OECD countries after 1990 are mostly obtained from the OECD National Accounts, Volumes I and II (annual issues) and the Eurostat New Cronos database. Employment estimates are primarily taken from OECD: Labour Force Statistics (annual issues); Eurostats New Cronos database; the ILO estimates on employment; and the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies (WIIW). For countries outside of the OECD, the national accounts and labour statistics which were assembled from national sources by international organizations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the ILO and the United Nations Statistical Office were used as the point of departure.

(0-100) numeric gini_wb Income inequality GINI Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. (0-100) numeric lp_ocde GDP per hour worked Levels of GDP, GDP per capita and labour productivity are presented in current prices (national currency or current PPPs), constant prices (2015 PPPs), as well as current price and current PPPs compared to the USA. The use of these different measures depends on the aim of the analysis: If the aim is to compare countries GDP per capita or productivity levels for individual years, using data in current prices and current PPPs could provide interesting insights. However, if the aim is to look at developments of levels of GDP per capita or productivity over time, using data in constant prices and 2015 PPPs is more appropriate as these control also for relative prices over time in addition to those across countries. (0-100) numeric ulc_ocde Growth in ULC Unit Labour Cost (ULCS) is a measure of competitiveness. The estimates of labour productivity, capital services, MFP, and ULC are mainly based on GDP, labour compensation, population and employment data from the OECD National Accounts. ULCs can be calculated as the ratio of labour compensation to real GDP. It is also the equivalent of the ratio between labour compensation per labour input (per hour or per employee) worked and labour productivity . (0-100) numeric gdp_growth_pc_ocde Growth in GDP per capita The estimates of labour productivity, capital services, MFP, and ULC are mainly based on GDP, labour compensation, population and employment data from the OECD National Accounts. Hours worked are sourced from the OECD National Accounts, the OECD Employment Outlook and national sources. Capital services estimates are based on OECD National Accounts as well as national data sources.

(0-8) numeric hourearn_fem_isco88_8 Mean nominal hourly earning of women Not elsewhere classified (ISCO88 classification) Imputed observations are not based on national data, are subject to high uncertainty and should not be used for country comparisons or rankings.The labour income share in GDP is the ratio, in percentage, between total labour income and gross domestic product (a measure of total output), both provided in nominal terms. Labour income includes the compensation of employees and part of the income of the self-employed. Self-employed workers earn from both their work and capital ownership. Total compensation of employees refers to the remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an enterprise to an employee in return for work done by the latter during the accounting period. The labour income of self-employed is imputed on the basis of a statistical analysis of employees of similar characteristics. The labour income share after accounting for the labour income of the self-employed is often referred to as the adjusted labour income share in GDP. The series is part of the ILO modelled estimates and is harmonized to account for differences in national data and scope of coverage, collection and tabulation methodologies as well as for other country-specific factors. We use data that comes from administrative data, imputed and modelled observations. (0-8) numeric hourearn_fem_isco88_9 Mean nominal monthly earning of employees (U.S. dollars) The employed comprise all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period, were in the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). Data are provided by institutional sector, which refers to disaggregations by public and private sector employment. Public sector employment covers employment in the government sector plus employment in publicly-owned resident enterprises and companies, operating at central, state (or regional) and local levels of government. It covers all persons employed directly by those institutions, regardless of the particular type of employment contract. Private sector employment comprises employment in all resident units operated by private enterprises, that is, it excludes enterprises controlled or operated by the government sector.

The employed comprise all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period, were in one of the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). Data are disaggregated by status in employment according to the latest version of the International Standard Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE-93). Status in employment refers to the type of explicit or implicit contract of employment the person has with other persons or organizations. The basic criteria used to define the groups of the classification are the type of economic risk and the type of authority over establishments and other workers which the job incumbents have or will have.

GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. (0-100) numeric gni_per_capita_wdi GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$) GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (0-100) numeric gni_per_capita_ppp_wdi GNI per capita, PPP (current international $) This indicator provides per capita values for gross national income (GNI. Formerly GNP) expressed in current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. PPP conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that eliminates the effects of the differences in price levels between countries.

Employment is defined as persons of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period (i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour) or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements. Ages 15 and older are generally considered the working-age population. (0-100) numeric gini_in_wdi GINI index (World Bank estimate) Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

The score is computed based on the methodology in the DB17-20 studies for topics that underwent methodology updates. (1-8) numeric db_wdi Ease of doing business score (0 = lowest performance to 100 = best performance) Distance to frontier score illustrates the distance of an economy to the frontier, which represents the best performance observed on each Doing Business topic across all economies and years included since 2005. An economys distance to frontier is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in 2012 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across time. A score of 80 in 2013 would indicate the economy is improving.

In between elections, there is freedom of expression and an independent media capable of presenting alternative views on matters of political relevance. In the V-Dem conceptual scheme, electoral democracy is understood as an essential element of any other conception of representative democracy liberal, participatory, deliberative, egalitarian, or some other. The index is formed by taking the average of, on the one hand, the weighted average of the indices measuring freedom of association thick (v2x_frassoc_thick), clean elections (v2xel_frefair), freedom of expression (v2x_freexp_altinf), elected officials (v2x_elecoff), and suffrage (v2x_suffr) and, on the other, the five-way multiplicative interaction between those indices.

It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies. To make it a measure of participatory democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account. The index is aggregated using this formula: v2x_partipdem = .25 * v2x_polyarchy^1.585 + .25 * v2x_partip + .5 * v2x_polyarchy^1.585 * v2x_partip (0-1) numeric del_dem_vdem Deliberative democracy index The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisionsas contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levelsfrom preference formation to final decisionamong informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account. The index is aggregated using this formula: v2x_delibdem = .25 * v2x_polyarchy^1.585 + .25 * v2x_delib + .5 * v2x_polyarchy^1.585 * v2x_delib (0-1) numeric freedom_exp_vdem Freedom of Expression and Alternative Sources of Information index To what extent does government respect press and media freedom, the freedom of ordinary people to discuss political matters at home and in the public sphere, as well as the freedom of academic and cultural expression. The index is formed by taking the point estimates from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for media censorship effort (v2mecenefm), harassment of journalists (v2meharjrn), media bias (v2mebias), media self-censorship (v2meslfcen), print/broadcast media critical (v2mecrit), and print/broadcast media perspectives (v2merange), freedom of discussion for men/women (v2cldiscm, v2cldiscw), and freedom of academic and cultural expression (v2clacfree). (0-1) numeric share_suff_vdem Share of population with suffrage This question does not take into consideration restrictions based on age, residence, having been convicted for crime, or being legally incompetent. It covers legal de jure restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice de facto. The adult population as defined by statute is defined by citizens in the case of independent countries or the people living in the territorial entity in the case of colonies. Universal suffrage is coded as 100%. Universal male suffrage only is coded as 50%. Years before electoral provisions are introduced are scored 0%. The scores do not reflect whether an electoral regime was interrupted or not. Only if new constitutions, electoral laws, or the like explicitly introduce new regulations of suffrage, the scores were adjusted accordingly if the changes suggested doing so. If qualifying criteria other than gender apply such as property, tax payments, income, literacy, region, race, ethnicity, religion, and/or economic independence, estimates have been calculated by combining information on the restrictions with different kinds of statistical information on population size, age distribution, wealth distribution, literacy rates, size of ethnic groups, etc., secondary country-specific sources, and  in the case of very poor information  the conditions in similar countries or colonies. The scores reflect de jure provisions of suffrage extension in percentage of the adult population. If the suffrage law is revised in a way that affects the extension, the scores reflect this change as of the calendar year the law was enacted. Aggregation: v2elsuffrage/100 (0-1) numeric clean_elect_vdem Clean elections index Free and fair connotes an absence of registration fraud, systematic irregularities, government intimidation of the opposition, vote buying, and election violence.The index is formed by taking the point estimates from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for EMB autonomy (v2elembaut), EMB capacity (v2elembcap), election voter registry (v2elrgstry), election vote buying (v2elvotbuy), election other voting irregularities (v2elirreg), election government intimidation (v2elintim), non state electoral violence (v2elpeace), and election free and fair (v2elfrfair). Since the bulk of these indicators are only observed in election years, the index scores have then been repeated within election regime periods as defined by v2x_elecreg. For the US and UK, the only two countries holding national elections prior to 1789 but with their first election within our sampling period occurring only in 1790, we have backfilled this index for 1789 with the value observed in 1790. (0-1) numeric cs_part_vdem Civil society participation index The sphere of civil society lies in the public space between the private sphere and the state. Here, citizens organize in groups to pursue their collective interests and ideals. We call these groups civil society organizations CSOs. CSOs include, but are by no means limited to, interest groups, labor unions, spiritual organizations if they are engaged in civic or political activities, social movements, professional associations, charities, and other non-governmental organizations. The core civil society index CCSI is designed to provide a measure of a robust civil society, understood as one that enjoys autonomy from the state and in which citizens freely and actively pursue their political and civic goals, however conceived. The index is formed by taking the point estimates from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for candidate selection  national/local (v2pscnslnl), CSO consultation (v2cscnsult), CSO participatory environment (v2csprtcpt), and CSO women participation (v2csgender).

Here, civil liberties are understood to include access to justice, private property rights, freedom of movement, and freedom from forced labor. 0: Poor people enjoy much fewer civil liberties than rich people. 1: Poor people enjoy substantially fewer civil liberties than rich people. 2: Poor people enjoy moderately fewer civil liberties than rich people. 3: Poor people enjoy slightly fewer civil liberties than rich people. 4: Poor people enjoy the same level of civil liberties as rich people. numeric freedom_cult_vdem Freedom of academic and cultural expression Whether there is academic freedom and freedom of cultural expression related to political issues or not 0: Not respected by public authorities. Censorship and intimidation are frequent. Academic activities and cultural expressions are severely restricted or controlled by the government. 1: Weakly respected by public authorities. Academic freedom and freedom of cultural expression are practiced occasionally, but direct criticism of the government is mostly met with repression. 2: Somewhat respected by public authorities. Academic freedom and freedom of cultural expression are practiced routinely, but strong criticism of the government is sometimes met with repression. 3: Mostly respected by public authorities. There are few limitations on academic freedom and freedom of cultural expression, and resulting sanctions tend to be infrequent and soft. 4: Fully respected by public authorities.

Gauges the degree to which the state owns and controls capital (including land) in the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. it dos not measure the extent of government revenue and expenditure as a share of total output; indeed, it is quite common for states with expansive fiscal policies to exercise little direct control (and virtually no ownership) over the economy 0: Virtually all valuable capital belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state. Private property may be officially prohibited. 1: Most valuable capital either belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state. 2: Many sectors of the economy either belong to the state or are directly controlled by the state, but others remain relatively free of direct state control. 3: Some valuable capital either belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state, but most remains free of direct state control. 4: Very little valuable capital belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state. numeric cso_control_vdem CSO entry and exit To what extent the government does achieve control over entry and exit by civil society organizations (CSOs) into public life? 0: Monopolistic control. The government exercises an explicit monopoly over CSOs. The only organizations allowed to engage in political activity such as endorsing parties or politicians, sponsoring public issues forums, organizing rallies or demonstrations, engaging in strikes, or publicly commenting on public officials and policies are government-sponsored organizations. The government actively represses those who attempt to defy its monopoly on political activity. 1: Substantial control. The government licenses all CSOs and uses political criteria to bar organizations that are likely to oppose the government. There are at least some citizen-based organizations that play a limited role in politics independent of the government. The government actively represses those who attempt to flout its political criteria and bars them from any political activity. 2: Moderate control. Whether the government ban on independent CSOs is partial or full, some prohibited organizations manage to play an active political role. Despite its ban on organizations of this sort, the government does not or cannot repress them, due to either its weakness or political expedience. 3: Minimal control. Whether or not the government licenses CSOs, there exist constitutional provisions that allow the government to ban organizations or movements that have a history of anti-democratic action in the past (e.g. the banning of neo-fascist or communist organizations in the Federal Republic of Germany). Such banning takes place under strict rule of law and conditions of judicial independence. 4: Unconstrained. Whether or not the government licenses CSOs, the government does not impede their formation and operation unless they are engaged in activities to violently overthrow the government. numeric cso_rep_vdem CSO repression If the government attempt to repress civil society organizations (CSOs) 0: Severely. The government violently and actively pursues all real and even some imagined members of CSOs. They seek not only to deter the activity of such groups but to effectively liquidate them. Examples include Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China. 1: Substantially. In addition to the kinds of harassment outlined in responses 2 and 3 below, the government also arrests, tries, and imprisons leaders of and participants in oppositional CSOs who have acted lawfully. Other sanctions include disruption of public gatherings and violent sanctions of activists (beatings, threats to families, destruction of valuable property). Examples include Mugabes Zimbabwe, Poland under Martial Law, Serbia under Milosevic. 2: Moderately. In addition to material sanctions outlined in response 3 below, the government also engages in minor legal harassment (detentions, short-term incarceration) to dissuade CSOs from acting or expressing themselves. The government may also restrict the scope of their actions through measures that restrict association of civil society organizations with each other or political parties, bar civil society organizations from taking certain actions, or block international contacts. Examples include post-Martial Law Poland, Brazil in the early 1980s, the late Franco period in Spain. 3: Weakly. The government uses material sanctions (fines, firings, denial of social services) to deter oppositional CSOs from acting or expressing themselves. They may also use burdensome registration or incorporation procedures to slow the formation of new civil society organizations and sidetrack them from engagement. The government may also organize Government Organized Movements or NGOs (GONGOs) to crowd out independent organizations. One example would be Singapore in the post-Yew phase or Putins Russia. 4: No. Civil society organizations are free to organize, associate, strike, express themselves, and to criticize the government without fear of government sanctions or harassment. numeric cso_consult_vdem CSO consultation If major civil society organizations (CSOs) are routinely consulted by policymakers on policies relevant to their members 0: No. There is a high degree of insulation of the government from CSO input. The government may sometimes enlist or mobilize CSOs after policies are adopted to sell them to the public at large. But it does not often consult with them in formulating policies. 1: To some degree. CSOs are but one set of voices that policymakers sometimes take into account.: Yes. Important CSOs are recognized as stakeholders in important policy areas and given voice on such issues. This can be accomplished through formal corporatist arrangements or through less formal arrangements. numeric cso_women_vdem CSO womens participation If women are prevented from participating in civil society organizations (CSOs). Please pay attention to both (A) whether women are prevented from participating in civil society organizations (CSOs) because of their gender and (B) whether CSOs pursuing womens interests are prevented from taking part in associational life. 0: Almost always. 1: Frequently. 2: About half the time. 3: Rarely. 4: Almost never. numeric censorship_media_vdem Government censorship effort - Media If the government directly or indirectly attempts to censor the print or broadcast media. Indirect forms of censorship might include politically motivated awarding of broadcast frequencies, withdrawal of financial support, influence over printing facilities and distribution networks, selected distribution of advertising, onerous registration requirements, prohibitive tariffs, and bribery. We are not concerned with censorship of non-political topics such as child pornography, statements offensive to a particular religion, or defamatory speech unless this sort of censorship is used as a pretext for censoring political speech. 0: Attempts to censor are direct and routine. 1: Attempts to censor are indirect but nevertheless routine. 2: Attempts to censor are direct but limited to especially sensitive issues. 3: Attempts to censor are indirect and limited to especially sensitive issues. 4: The government rarely attempts to censor major media in any way, and when such exceptional attempts are discovered, the responsible officials are usually punished. numeric censorship_internet_vdem Internet censorship effort If the government attempts to censor information (text, audio, or visuals) on the Internet. Censorship attempts include Internet filtering (blocking access to certain websites or browsers), denial-of-service attacks, and partial or total Internet shutdowns. We are not concerned with censorship of topics such as child pornography, highly classified information such as military or intelligence secrets, statements offensive to a particular religion, or defamatory speech unless this sort of censorship is used as a pretext for censoring political information or opinions. We are also not concerned with the extent of internet access, unless there is absolutely no access at all (in which case the coding should be 0). 0 (1): The government successfully blocks Internet access except to sites that are pro-government or devoid of political content. 1 (2): The government attempts to block Internet access except to sites that are pro-government or devoid of political content, but many users are able to circumvent such controls. 2 (3): The government allows Internet access, including to some sites that are critical of the government, but blocks selected sites that deal with especially politically sensitive issues. 3 (4): The government allows Internet access that is unrestricted, with the exceptions mentioned above. numeric power_dist_socpos_vdem Power distributed by socioeconomic position If political power is distributed according to socioeconomic position. All societies are characterized by some degree of economic (wealth and income) inequality. In some societies, income and wealth are distributed in a grossly unequal fashion. In others, the difference between rich and poor is not so great. Here, we are concerned not with the degree of social inequality but rather with the political effects of this inequality. Specifically, we are concerned with the extent to which wealth and income translates into political power. 0: Wealthy people enjoy a virtual monopoly on political power. Average and poorer people have almost no influence. 1: Wealthy people enjoy a dominant hold on political power. People of average income have little say. Poorer people have essentially no influence. 2: Wealthy people have a very strong hold on political power. People of average or poorer income have some degree of influence but only on issues that matter less for wealthy people. 3: Wealthy people have more political power than others. But people of average income have almost as much influence and poor people also have a significant degree of political power. 4: Wealthy people have no more political power than those whose economic status is average or poor. Political power is more or less equally distributed across economic groups. numeric power_dist_socgrp_vdem Power distributed by social group If political power is distributed according to social groups. A social group is differentiated within a country by caste, ethnicity, language, race, region, religion, or some combination thereof. (It does not include identities grounded in sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.) Social group identity is contextually defined and is likely to vary across countries and through time. Social group identities are also likely to cross-cut, so that a given person could be defined in multiple ways, i.e., as part of multiple groups. Nonetheless, at any given point in time there are social groups within a society that are understood  by those residing within that society  to be different, in ways that may be politically relevant. 0: Political power is monopolized by one social group comprising a minority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change. 1: Political power is monopolized by several social groups comprising a minority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change. 2: Political power is monopolized by several social groups comprising a majority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change. 3: Either all social groups possess some political power, with some groups having more power than others; or different social groups alternate in power, with one group controlling much of the political power for a period of time, followed by another  but all significant groups have a turn at the seat of power. 4: All social groups have roughly equal political power or there are no strong ethnic, caste, linguistic, racial, religious, or regional differences to speak of. Social group characteristics are not relevant to politics. numeric power_dist_gender_vdem Power distributed by gender If political power is distributed according to gender. 0: Men have a near-monopoly on political power. 1: Men have a dominant hold on political power. Women have only marginal influence. 2: Men have much more political power but women have some areas of influence. 3: Men have somewhat more political power than women. 4: Men and women have roughly equal political power. numeric educ_eq_vdem Educational equality To what extent high quality basic education is guaranteed to all, sufficient to enable them to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens 0: Extreme. Provision of high quality basic education is extremely unequal and at least 75 percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens. 1: Unequal. Provision of high quality basic education is extremely unequal and at least 25 percent (%) of children receive such low quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens. 2: Somewhat equal. Basic education is relatively equal in quality but ten to 25 percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens. 3: Relatively equal. Basic education is overall equal in quality but five to ten percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that probably undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens. 4: Equal. Basic education is equal in quality and less than five percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that probably undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens. numeric pol_polarization_vdem Political polarization If the society is polarized into antagonistic, political camps. Here we refer to the extent to which political differences affect social relationships beyond political discussions. Societies are highly polarized if supporters of opposing political camps are reluctant to engage in friendly interactions, for example, in family functions, civic associations, their free time activities and workplaces 0: Not at all. Supporters of opposing political camps generally interact in a friendly manner. 1: Mainly not. Supporters of opposing political camps are more likely to interact in a friendly than a hostile manner. 2: Somewhat. Supporters of opposing political camps are equally likely to interact in a friendly or hostile manner. 3: Yes, to noticeable extent. Supporters of opposing political camps are more likely to interact in a hostile than friendly manner. 4: Yes, to a large extent. Supporters of opposing political camps generally interact in a hostile manner. numeric pol_violence_vdem Political violence How often non-state actors have used political violence against persons this year. We understand political violence as the use of physical force to achieve political objectives by non-state actors. The restriction to political objectives excludes profit-driven crime-related violence, for instance. By non-state actors we refer to individuals or entities that are not formally part of the state. Thus, politically oriented militias and youth groups count as non-state actors even though they might potentially be informally affiliated with the ruling party or the state. Political violence against persons excludes psychological and symbolic violence (e.g. destruction of objects). 0: Not at all. Non-state actors did not use political violence. 1: Rare. Non-state actors rarely used political violence. 2: Occasionally. Non-state actors occasionally used political violence. 3: Frequently. Non-state actors frequently used political violence. 4: Often. Non-state actors often used political violence. numeric mass_mob_vdem Mass mobilization How frequent and large have events of mass mobilization been this year. This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins. These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns state-orchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government). 0: There have been virtually no events. 1: There have been several small-scale events. 2: There have been many small-scale events. 3: There have been several large-scale and small-scale events. 4: There have been many large-scale and small-scale events. numeric labor_rights_vdem Labor rights If labor force enjoys the right to organiz freely anda bargain collectively. Refers to actual practice not formal (de jure) rights. If practices vary across the country, or across sectores, please consider the overall situation of labor. 0: Independent labor unions (free from state or ruling party control) are not allowed. 1: Independent labor unions are allowed, at least in some sectors of the economy or some sections of the country. However, they are subject to harassment by the police, paramilitary groups, business associations, or other groups. Harassment refers to systematic beatings, imprisonment, outlawing of specific unions, and other actions that seriously impinge upon the ability of unions to organize and bargain collectively. 2: Independent labor unions are allowed and they do not face violent repression but the legal climate is not friendly (e.g., closed shop rules are widespread), making it difficult to organize and bargain collectively. 3: Independent labor unions are allowed and may organize freely in all sectors of the economy. numeric mw_vdem Minimum wage If there is a minimum wage 0: No. 1: Yes, the state imposes a minimum wage (legislation, regulations). 2: Yes, there are corporate bargaining arrangements that effectively ensure a minimum wage. 3: Yes, there is a tripartite committee that sets the wage (representatives from union, employer, government). numeric reg_world_vdem Regimes of the World How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of acces to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles. Electoral democracies score above 2 on the indicators for multiparty (v2elmulpar_osp) and free and fair elections (v2elfrfair_osp), as well as above 0.5 on the Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy). Liberal democracy meets the criteria for Electoral democracy but also satisfy the liberal dimensions by a score above 0.8 on the VDem Liberal Component index (v2x_liberal), as well as a score above 3 on transparent law enforcement (v2cltrnslw_osp), access to justice for men (v2clacjstm_osp) and women (v2clacjstw_osp). Electoral autocracies fail to meet one or more of the abovementioned criteria of electoral democracies, but subject the chief executive and the legislature to dejure multiparty elections as indicated by a score above 1 on the VDem multiparty elections indicator (v2elmulpar_osp). Closed autocracy if either no multiparty elections for the legislature take place (v2xlg_elecreg == 0) or the chief executive is not elected in direct or indirect multiparty elections. To identify whether this is the case, we take into account if there is no basic multiparty competition in elections (v2elmulpar_osp &lt; 1) and the relative power of the Head of State (HoS) and the Head of Government (HoG) as well as the appointment procedures. The VDem variable v2ex_hosw identifies if the HoS (v2ex_hosw&gt; 0.5) or HoG (v2ex_hosw &lt; or equal to 0.5) is the chief executive. If the HoG is the chief executive, the variable v2expathhg indicates whether the HoG is directly (8) or indirectly (7) elected or appointed by the HoS (6). In the first case, we consider whether executive elections (v2xex_elecreg == 0) take place, in the second case whether legislative elections take place (v2xlg_elecreg == 0) and in the third case how HoS is selected as follows. The variable v2expathhs indicates whether the HoS is directly (7) or indirectly (6) elected. Thus, in the first case, we consider whether executive elections (v2xex_elecreg) take place, in the second case whether legislative elections take place and the legislature approves on HoG (v2xlg_elecreg == 0 and v2exaphog == 0). This also applies for the cases if the HoS is the chief executive. 0: Closed autocracy: No multiparty elections for the chief executive or the legislature. 1: Electoral autocracy: De-jure multiparty elections for the chief executive and the legislature, but failing to achieve that elections are free and fair, or de-facto multiparty, or a minimum level of Dahls institutional prerequisites of polyarchy as measured by V-Dems Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy). 2: Electoral democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahls institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dems Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy), but either access to justice, or transparent law enforcement, or liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive not satisfied as measured by V-Dems Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal). 3: Liberal democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahls institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dems Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy) are guaranteed as well as access to justice, transparent law enforcement and the liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive satisfied as measured by V-Dems Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal). numeric dir_elect_vdem Direct election dimension Index To what extent the power base of the chief executive is determined by direct election. Representing one of five regime dimensions, each of which may be more or less present in any given case, this index taps into the extent to which the chief executive is appointed through direct popular election (regardless of the quality or extension of suffrage of that election). The index is based on whether the chief executive was directly elected. In nominally dual systems, where the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG) are not the same individual, we determine who is the chief executive by comparing HOS and HOG powers over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers. We aggregate across the two executives by taking the average weighted by their relative powers over cabinet formation and dismissal. (0-1) numeric hereditary_dim_vdem Hereditary dimension Index To what extent the power base of the chief executive is determined by hereditary succesion. Representing one of five regime dimensions, each of which may be more or less present in any given case, this index taps into the extent to which the appointment and dismissal of the chief executive is based on hereditary rule. The index is based on whether the chief executive was (a) appointed through hereditary sucession or by a royal council, and (b) can be dismissed by a royal council. Both condition (a) and (b) are coded as present (1) or not (0); we then average across the two. In nominally dual systems, where the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG) are not the same individual, we determine who is the chief executive by comparing HOS and HOG powers over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers. We aggregate across the two executives by taking the average weighted by their relative powers over cabinet formation and dismissal. (0-1) numeric military_dim_vdem Military dimension Index To what extent the power base of the chief executive is determined by the military. Representing one of five regime dimensions, each of which may be more or less present in any given case, this index taps into the extent to which the appointment and dismissal of the chief executive is based on the threat or actual use of military force.The index is based on whether the chief executive was (a) appointed through a coup, rebellion or by the miliyary, and (b) can be dismissed by a the military. Both condition (a) and (b) are coded as present (1) or not (0); we then average across the two. In nominally dual systems, where the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG) are not the same individual, we determine who is the chief executive by comparing HOS and HOG powers over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers. We aggregate across the two executives by taking the average weighted by their relative powers over cabinet formation and dismissal. (0-1) numeric neopat_rule_vdem Neopatrimonial Rule Index To what extent rule is based on personal authority. Neopatrimonial rule reflects the idea that personalistic forms of authority pervade formal regime institutions (Clapham, 1985). According to Bratton and Van de Walle (1997) a neopatrimonialism regime is one that combines clientelistic political relationships, strong and unconstrained presidents and the use of public resources for political legitimation. The index is constructed using Bayesian Factor Analysis of 16 indicators representing these three concepts. The sixteen indicators are those included in the three sub-indices: Clientelism, Presidentialism and Regime Corruption. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better. The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores = more neopatrimonialism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for vote buying (v2elvotbuy), particularistic vs. public goods (v2dlencmps), party linkages (v2psprlnks), executive respects constitution (v2exrescon), executive oversight (v2lgotovst), legislature controls resources (v2lgfunds), legislature investigates the executive in practice (v2lginvstp), high court independence (V2juhcind), low court independence (v2jucnind),compliance with high court (v2juhccomp), compliance with judiciary (v2jucomp), electoral management body autonomy (v2elembaut), executive embezzlement and theft (v2exembez), executive bribes and corrupt exchanges (v2exbribe), legislative corruption (v2lgcrrpt) and judicial corruption (v2jucorrdc). (0-1) numeric clientelism_vdem Clientelism Index To what extent politics are based on clientelistic relationships. Clientelistic relationships include the targeted, contingent distribution of resources (goods, services, jobs, money, etc) in exchange for political support. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better. The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores = more clientelism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for vote-buying (v2elvotbuy), particularistic vs. public goods (v2dlencmps) and whether party linkages are programmatic or clientelistic (v2psprlnks). (0-1) numeric presidentialism_vdem Presidentialism Index To what extent the regime is characterized by presidentialism. Presidentialism means the systemic concentration of political power in the hands of one individual who resists delegating all but the most trivial decision making tasks (Bratton and Van de Walle, 1997: 63). It relates closely to V-Dems index of Horizontal Accountability (v2x_horacc) but focuses more specifically on the extent to which the President is free from constraints by other institutions or actors. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better. The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores = more presidentialism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for executive respect for the constitution (v2exrescon), whether there are mechanisms for oversight of the executive other than the legislature (v2lgotovst). For legislative constraints, the index includes an indicator of whether the legislature controls its own resources (v2lgfunds) and investigates the executive in practice (v2lginvstp). There are four indicators of judicial constraints on the executive: high court independence (v2juhcind), lower court independence (v2jucnind), compliance with high court (v2juhccomp) and compliance with judiciary (v2jucomp). Finally, the index includes a measure of autonomy of the electoral management body (v2elembaut) that captures whether or not the President can influence its decisions and actions. (0-1) numeric civ_liberties_vdem Civil liberties Index To what extent is civil liberty respected. Civil liberty is understood as liberal freedom, where freedom is a property of individuals. Civil liberty is constituted by the absence of physical violence committed by government agents and the absence of constraints of private liberties and political liberties by the government. The index is formed by taking the average of physical violence index (v2x_clphy), political civil liberties index (v2x_clpol), and private civil liberties (v2x_clpriv). (0-1) numeric physical_violence_vdem Physical Violence Index To what extent physical integrity is respected. Physical integrity is understood as freedom from political killings and torture by the government. Among the set of civil liberties, these liberal rights are the most relevant for political competition and accountability. The index is based on indicators that reflect violence committed by government agents and that are not directly referring to elections. (0-1) numeric political_corruption_vdem Political corruption index How pervasive is political corruption. The directionality of the V-Dem corruption index runs from less corrupt to more corrupt unlike the other V-Dem variables that generally run from less democratic to more democratic situation. The corruption index includes measures of six distinct types of corruption that cover both different areas and levels of the polity realm, distinguishing between executive, legislative and judicial corruption. Within the executive realm, the measures also distinguish between corruption mostly pertaining to bribery and corruption due to embezzlement. Finally, they differentiate between corruption in the highest echelons of the executive at the level of the rulers/cabinet on the one hand, and in the public sector at large on the other. The measures thus tap into several distinguished types of corruption: both petty and grand; both bribery and theft; both corruption aimed and influencing law making and that affecting implementation. (0-1) numeric women_empower_vdem Women political empowerment index How politically empowered are women. Womens political empowerment is defined as a process of increasing capacity for women, leading to greater choice, agency, and participation in societal decision-making. It is understood to incorporate three equally-weighted dimensions: fundamental civil liberties, womens open discussion of political issues and participation in civil society organizations, and the descriptive representation of women in formal political positions. The index is formed by taking the average of womens civil liberties index (v2x_gencl), womens civil society participation index (v2x_gencs), and womens political participation index (v2x_genpp). (0-1) numeric democracy_vdem Democracy If the country is democratic. Dichotomous democracy measure based on contestation and participation. Countries coded democratic have (1) political leaders that are chosen through free and fair elections and (2) a minimal level of suffrage. 0= No, 1= Yes numeric democracy_break_vdem Democratic breakdowns How many previous democratic breakdowns ocurred 0-8 numeric avg_educ_vdem Education +15 Average years of education among citizens older than 15. 0-8 numeric gini_vdem Educational inequality, Gini How unequal is the level of education achieved by the population aged 15 years and older. Gini coefficient of educational inequality estimated from average education data using the method as suggested by Thomas, Wang, and Fan (2000), Checchi (2004) and Castelló and Doménech (2000: 4). Van Leeuwen, van Leeuwen-Li, and Foldvari (N.d.) provide a more detailed explanation in the Clio-Infra codebook. (0-1) numeric exports_vdem Exports Total value of a countrys exports in 2014 US millions of dollars 0-8 numeric imports_vdem Imports Total value of a countrys imports in 2014 US millions of dollars. 0-8 numeric gdp_growth_vdem GDP growth GDP per capita growth rate, estimated from the variable GDP per capita. 0-8 numeric gdp_percapita_vdem GDP per capita GDP per capita, refering to gross domestic production, understood on a per capita basis 0-8 numeric inflation_vdem Inflation Annual inflation rate 0-8 numeric fertility_vdem Fertility rate The fertility rate (i.e. total fertility rate, period total fertility rate, total period fertility rate) of a population is the mean number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if (a) she were to experience the current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime, and (b) she were to survive through the end of her reproductive life. It is obtained by adding single-year age-specific rates at a given time. 0-8 numeric population_vdem Population total Total population in thousands 0-8 numeric "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
